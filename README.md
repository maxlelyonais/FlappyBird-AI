# Flappy Bird with NEAT AI

This is a Python script that implements the Flappy Bird game using the Pygame library and trains AI agents to play the game using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python
- Pygame library
- NEAT library

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the code.

2. Run the script to train AI agents:

To test the best-performing network:

Copy code
python flappy_bird_neat.py --test

Code Overview
The code is structured as follows:

Initialization of Pygame and game assets.
Button and classes for the Bird and Obstacles.
Functions for score display and the death window.
AI training functions (train_ai and test_ai) using NEAT.
Main function for setting up configuration and running AI training.
Configuration
The config.txt file contains configuration parameters for the NEAT algorithm.
